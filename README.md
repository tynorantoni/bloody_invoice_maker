# bloody_invoice_maker

My first Spring Project. 

Version 1.0 
- Working web-app which allows users to fill up order form (patient data and order of blood components needed for transfusion).
- Currently "bloody_invoice_maker" creates invoice template in jsp file (downloads data from MySQL).
- In future versions invoice form will be created in pdf file.


Project will be developed along with progress of my learning.
